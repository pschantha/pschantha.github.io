            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                Born and raised here in Utah, I am a proud wife and mother to two beautiful daughters. Thrilled to
                embark on the enriching journey with the <b>Tech-Moms</b> program, I am eager to explore the myriad
                of opportunities it has in store for me.
            </p>

            <p>


                "A jack of all trades is a master of none, but oftentimes better than a master of one" perfectly
                encapsulates me. While I used to perceive the idea of not being a "master of one" negatively,
                I have come to embrace the empowering sentiment of "better than a master of one."

                My career journey began in the dynamic beauty industry, where I cultivated expertise through various
                roles in customer support and sales. Now, I am enthusiastically delving into the intersection of beauty
                and technology, aiming to integrate these two realms seamlessly into my future endeavors. I am eager to
                bridge the gap between my deep-rooted knowledge of the beauty industry and the rapidly advancing
                landscape of technology, embracing innovation and inclusivity every step of the way.
